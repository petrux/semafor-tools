Semafor tools
=============
Semafor tools is a (tiny) project collecting some utilities in order to cope with the [SEMAFOR](http://www.ark.cs.cmu.edu/SEMAFOR/) output. In order to use the semafor tools (which are actually contained in a single module) you need:

* [Python 2.7](http://www.python.org/download/releases/2.7/) or higher
* [lxml](http://lxml.de/index.html)
